# Improving Employee Retention by Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning

### Goals:
- Understand how to retain employees in the company.
- Identify primary factors causing discomfort among employees.

### Tools Used:
- Jupyter Notebook

### Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Classification Modeling**

### Results:
- **Toxic Culture as the Main Reason**: Our findings indicate that the work culture for data analysts doesn't prioritize employee welfare.
- **Model Performance**: The Stacking model yielded impressive recall and F1 scores on both training and test data.
- **Key Features**: Age emerged as a significant predictor. Other essential features included Employee Performance and Employee Satisfaction Score.
- **Risk Groups**:
    - Employees aged 26-35 and those above 51 have a higher propensity to resign.
    - Employees scoring 1 on satisfaction are more likely to leave.
    - Interns exhibit a high 70% chance of resignation.

### Suggestions:
- **Considering Age**: Cater to the unique needs of employees at various career stages. Younger talents may benefit from mentorships and competitive pay, while older employees might appreciate ongoing growth opportunities.
- **Performance Management**: Recognize and provide growth paths for high performers. For those underperforming, consider bolstering training and coaching.
- **Job Evaluation**: Reassess roles or employment statuses that the model flags as high risk. This might involve recalibrating compensation, reassessing workloads, or revamping working conditions.
- **Employee Satisfaction Surveys**: Given the significance of satisfaction scores, regular surveys can offer deeper insights into employee sentiments and guide remedial actions.
- **Enhanced Onboarding for Interns**: A more comprehensive onboarding process can help interns align better with company expectations and their roles.
